Champ is a gigantic pre-historic monster trapped in the land-locked waters of Lake Champlain. Despite multiple attempts to escape through manmade avenues, he's just too much junk in the trunk so he's here to stay.

He has developed a taste for Lake Trout and Walleye, though he doesn't like the taste of smallmouth bass he prefers to enjoy watching local fisherman catch them.

When he's not chasing fish or sunbathing Champ can be found searching the depths of Lake Champlain for once forgotten relics and fishing lures that he sells on this website.
